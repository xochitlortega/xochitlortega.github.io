        <p id="p">  &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Xochitl Ortega and I'm a first-year scholar at SMASH. I currently attend San Leandro High School and I'm about to be a sophomore. I enjoy food in general, watching Netflix and listening to music. My current food crave is hot Cheetos and tacos. I am currently rewatching The Get Down on Netflix. One of my favorite artist is Frank Ocean and I have been recently listening to Damn by Kendrick Lamar.  </p>
